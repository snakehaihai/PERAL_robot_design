# CAD Design Files

This directory contains CAD files for the PERAL spherical robot mechanical design.

## File Organization

### Shell Design (`shell/`)
- Outer spherical shell CAD models
- Material: Transparent polycarbonate or acrylic
- Features: Mounting points, access panels, sealing

### Frame Design (`frame/`)
- Internal support frame
- Motor mounting brackets
- Battery holder
- Sensor mounts

### Assembly (`assembly/`)
- Complete robot assembly models
- Exploded views for documentation
- Assembly sequence models

## CAD Software

Recommended software:
- **FreeCAD** (open-source)
- **Fusion 360** (free for hobbyists)
- **SolidWorks** (professional)
- **Onshape** (cloud-based)

## File Formats

Please save designs in multiple formats:
1. **Native format** (e.g., `.FCStd`, `.f3d`, `.SLDPRT`)
2. **STEP** (`.step`, `.stp`) - for universal compatibility
3. **STL** (`.stl`) - for 3D printing
4. **PDF/DXF** - for 2D drawings
