# Sourcing Information

This directory contains information about where to purchase components, materials, and tools for the PERAL robot project.

## Directory Structure

### `components/`
List electronic components and their sources:
- Microcontrollers and processors
- Sensors (LiDAR, IMU, encoders)
- Motors and actuators
- Power supplies and batteries
- Communication modules

**Create files like**: `sensors.md`, `motors.md`, `electronics.md`

### `materials/`
List materials needed for construction:
- 3D printing filaments
- Structural materials (aluminum, acrylic, etc.)
- Fasteners and hardware
- Cables and connectors
- Adhesives and tools

**Create files like**: `3d_printing.md`, `structural_materials.md`, `hardware.md`

### `vendors/`
List vendor information and contacts:
- Recommended suppliers
- Contact information
- Lead times and shipping info
- Bulk purchase options
- Educational discounts

**Create files like**: `recommended_vendors.md`, `local_suppliers.md`

## Template for Component Lists

```

## Budget Tracking

Consider creating a spreadsheet to track:
- Total component costs
- Budget allocation
- Purchased vs. needed items
- Order status

## Tips

1. **Compare prices**: Check multiple vendors before purchasing
2. **Educational discounts**: Many suppliers offer student/educational pricing
3. **Bulk orders**: Consider combining orders to save on shipping
4. **Lead times**: Plan ahead for components with long delivery times
5. **Alternatives**: Always list backup suppliers or alternative components

## Making Purchases

Before making purchases:
1. Get approval from project supervisor
2. Verify budget availability
3. Check if component is already in stock
4. Coordinate with team to avoid duplicate orders

For purchase requests or questions, contact the project supervisor.
